# Groups

Groups are a way to organize your programs. You can create groups and add programs to them. This way you can easily find and launch programs.

## Creating a group

To create a group use "File" -> "New group". You will be prompted to enter the name of the group. You can't use a name that is already in use.

The new group will be created and you can add programs to it.

## Deleting a group

Empty groups will be removed automatically on exit.
